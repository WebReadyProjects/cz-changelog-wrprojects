## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case of a security incident, it is necessary to send an email to [Gr√©goire FAVREAU](mailto:gfavreau.wrprojects@gmail.com) who is responsible for this project.
For security incidents coming from the package itself please tag your mail as "[INC - GITHUB-TEMPLATE INTERNAL]" and be as concise as possible.
Since this project contains external packages, it is possible that updates regarding external vulnerabilities may take a long time to be resolved, however, please feel free to send an email with the tag "[INC - GITHUB-TEMPLATE EXTERNAL]" and to be as clear as possible.

We know that it takes time to report errors and we thank you in advance for your help :heart:
