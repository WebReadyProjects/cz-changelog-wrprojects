# Project Governance

## Maintainers

Maintainers have write access to [github-template](https://github.com/WebReadyProjects/github-template). They can merge their own patches or patches from others. Current maintainers can be found in [the OWNER]() file. Maintainers manage the project's resources and contributions collectively.

This privilege comes with an expectation of responsibility: maintainers are people who care about the [github-template](https://github.com/WebReadyProjects/github-template) project and can help it to develop and improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated the ability to collaborate with the team, to have code and documentation checked by the most knowledgeable people, to contribute high-quality code, and to resolve incidents (in code or in tests).

A maintainer is a citizen who helps the project succeed.

## Become a maintainer

To become a Maintainer, you must demonstrate the following:

- Commitment to the project:
  - Participate in dicussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews.
  - Conduct reviews for PRs.
  - Assist the community and perform merges.
- Ability to write quality code and/or documentation.
- Ability to collaborate with the team.
- Understanding of team operations (policies, testing and code review processes, etc).
- Understanding of the project code base and coding style.

A new maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by sending a message to the [IRC group for developers](). A simple majority vote of the existing maintainers approves the request.

Selected maintainers will receive the necessary GitHub rights and will be invited to the [IRC group for maintainers]().

## Vote

While most [github-template](https://github.com/WebReadyProjects/github-template) business is conducted by "lazy consensus", periodically maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes. A vote may be taken on [the IRC group for developers]() or on [the IRC group for managers]() for security or conduct issues.
Most votes require a simple majority of all maintainers to succeed. Maintainers can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all maintainers, and changes to this governance require a 2/3 vote of all maintainers.
